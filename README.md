# CS 220 Queue Monitor

Python script that monitors a Google Sheets-based student help queue and sends MacOS notifications when new requests arrive. 

Built this so that I can do other stuff instead of endlessly staring at the queue during office hours.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Google Cloud Console account
- Google Sheets API enabled
- MacOS system

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahir-2003/cs220-queue-monitor.git
